#Data Cleaning and Processing 

This Python script is designed to clean and process large CSV datasets efficiently. It performs various data cleaning operations, handles data validation, and uses a chunking approach to manage large files effectively.

## Features

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handles missing data
   - Removes duplicate entries
   - Converts data types
   - Handles outliers
   - Standardizes data formats

2. **Data Validation**
   - Includes example validation (e.g., email addresses using regex)

3. **Chunking**
   - Processes large CSV files in smaller chunks to manage memory efficiently
   - Saves intermediate results for each chunk

4. **Header Replacement**
   - Replaces existing headers with a custom list of headers

5. **Logging**
   - Logs processing steps and important information

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- os
- logging
- re

## Usage

1. Place your input CSV file in the same directory as the script.
2. Update the `input_file` variable with your CSV filename.
3. Adjust the `new_headers` list to match your dataset's structure.
4. Run the script:

   ```
   python data_cleaning_script.py
   ```

## Input

- A large CSV file containing the data to be cleaned and processed

## Output

The script generates two types of output files:

1. **Clean Data**: 
   - Saved in the `clean_files` directory
   - Final clean data saved as `clean_files/final_clean_data.csv`

2. **Garbage Data** (rows with missing or invalid data):
   - Saved in the `garbage_files` directory
   - Final garbage data saved as `garbage_files/final_garbage_data.csv`

## Process Flow

1. The script reads the input CSV in chunks.
2. For each chunk:
   - Handles missing data
   - Removes duplicates
   - Converts data types
   - Handles outliers
   - Standardizes data
   - Performs data validation (e.g., email addresses)
3. Separates clean and garbage data
4. Saves intermediate results for each chunk
5. Concatenates all processed chunks
6. Saves final clean and garbage datasets

## Logging

The script logs its activities to `data_processing.log`, including:
- Processing start and completion for each chunk
- Missing value counts
- Any errors or exceptions encountered

## Data Fields

The script is designed to work with a variety of data fields. The current implementation includes placeholders for the following types of data:

- Identification information (e.g., ID numbers, names)
- Personal information (e.g., gender, date of birth, marital status)
- Contact information (e.g., phone numbers, email addresses)
- Location data (e.g., address, city, province, postal code)
- Professional information (e.g., industry, education, salary)

Note: The exact fields can be customized by modifying the `new_headers` list in the script.

## Customization

- Adjust the `chunk_size` variable to optimize performance based on your system's memory.
- Modify the `new_headers` list to match your dataset's structure.
